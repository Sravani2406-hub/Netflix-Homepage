The Netflix homepage created using HTML and CSS is designed to mimic the appearance and layout of the actual Netflix homepage. Here's an explanation of the key components and features you might find on a typical Netflix homepage:

**Header Section:**

At the top of the page, there is a fixed header that contains the Netflix logo on the left and navigation links on the right.
Navigation links may include categories like Home, TV Shows, Movies, My List, and Search.

**Hero Section:**

The hero section is a prominent area that typically spans the full width of the page. It includes a large background image or video showcasing popular or featured content.
Overlaid on the background, there is often a title, tagline, and a prominent call-to-action button. This section is designed to grab the user's attention and promote featured content.

**Styling and Branding:**

The overall design follows Netflix's branding guidelines, including the use of the red and black color scheme.
Font styles, sizes, and other visual elements are chosen to create a cohesive and visually appealing interface.
